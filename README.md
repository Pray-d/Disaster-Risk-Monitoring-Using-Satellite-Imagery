# Disaster-Risk-Monitoring-Using-Satellite-Imagery
A suggestion of task provided by NIVIDEA in its course Disaster Risk Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery

Welcome to the "Disaster Risk Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery" course notebook repository. This repository contains the first notebook from the course, titled "01 - Disaster Risk Monitoring Systems and Data Pre-Processing." In this notebook, you will learn the motivation behind disaster risk monitoring and how to use hardware-accelerated tools to process large image data.

## N Overview

- ** Title:**- Disaster Risk Monitoring Systems and Data Pre-Processing


## Description

This notebook is the first part of the "Disaster Risk Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery" course. It introduces you to the critical concepts related to disaster risk monitoring and how satellite imagery, combined with computer vision and deep learning, can be used to detect and assess natural disasters, with a focus on flood events.

## Motivation

Natural disasters, such as floods, wildfires, droughts, and severe storms, have a significant impact on communities, economies, and the environment. The ability to monitor and predict these disasters using satellite imagery and advanced technology is crucial for effective disaster management and mitigation. This notebook sets the foundation for understanding the role of satellite imagery and deep learning in disaster risk monitoring.
